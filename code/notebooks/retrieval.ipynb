    "### Introduction\n",
    "- **Objective**: Develop and evaluate a question-answering model using the ConvFinQA dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval Technique\n",
    "- **Approach**: Implement a retrieval-based method to find relevant information from the dataset. This involves using an embeddings index and context augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- **Recall**: Measure the proportion of relevant information successfully retrieved by the model. Recall is calculated as the number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of relevant documents in the dataset. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of the retrieval technique in finding all pertinent information needed to answer the questions accurately.\n"
