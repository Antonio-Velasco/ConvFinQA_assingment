Sample Entry:
--------------------
Query: what portion of the future minimum payments are due in 2013?
Label: 9.6%
gpt-3.5-turbo answer: 
                            $28.7 million / $297.8 million = 0.0962, which is equal to 9.62%
gpt-3.5-turbo reflection:
                            To determine the portion of future minimum payments due in 2013, you would look at the specific amount allocated for 2013 and compare it to the total future minimum payments.

In this case, the future minimum payment due in 2013 is $28.7 million out of a total of $297.8 million.
Therefore, the portion of the future minimum payments due in 2013 is 9.62%. [$28.7 million / $297.8 million = 0.0962, which is equal to 9.62%]
